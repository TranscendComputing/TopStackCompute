TopStackCompute
===============

The TopStack compute service provides an EC2 Bridge for TopStack; AWS compatible operations for core infrastructure, 
from any cloud.  Compute services are, of course, available as native services from a cloud provider; but if you need 
standard, predictable APIs across cloud providers, to support tooling and automation, TopStackCompute can help.

This service is part of the TopStack suite of services.  You can find our more about TopStack on the main project page, 
http://topstack.org/

For build and installation steps, check the Wiki page for the TopStack master project.
